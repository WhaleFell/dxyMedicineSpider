## MyCuteGirl ! She's 14 years old in China.
# My story
## I was diagnosed with depression in my second year of junior high school.
## After that, I wasn't interested in anything..
## And than,I've been thinking all day about how to kill myself.
## My parents took me to a mental hospital to see a doctor, the doctor gave me a lot of medicine.
> 比如说: 碳酸锂,西酞普兰,阿米替林, **舍曲林没吃了副作用有点大**

## I began to become lazy and numb.
## I know I'm a waste of money living in this world...
# But it wasn't until I met her.....
> ## She's cute, and I love to pinch her face, and she's happy to do it
## She made me feel a little happy.
## But it won't cure my depression either.
## She was disappointed in me.
## 现在已经没去上学了,很快就要中考了,我也不知道怎么办了.每次抑郁发作都想跳楼.
# This is her.
